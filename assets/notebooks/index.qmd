## Synopsis

This is an example of how to use MultiQC in a Quarto notebook. MultiQC is a great tool for summarising log files of various tools.
One drawback though is you already need to be familiar with how to interpret the output of those tools in their context. For example,
FastQC is a bioinformatic tool that analyses sequence data, and produces PASS/FAIL metrics for various analyses. An underlying 
assumption is that the sequence data is whole genome sequence data, and therefore has certain properties. FastQC, however, can be used
on other types of sequence data, with the caveat that not all analyses need to pass or fail. This is confusing for those learning the
field who have never encountered this. 

This is where a Quarto notebook comes in. By using Multiqc as a Python package, one can narrate to the reader how to interpret plots, and which
analyses to focus on to answer particular questions. We can also use conditional inclusion to display only relevant sections. In this
way, we make it easier for newcomers to interpret analysis logs, particularly those using production-level workflows like [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/).
Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.
